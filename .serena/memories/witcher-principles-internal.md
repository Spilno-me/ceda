# Behind the Veil: Witcher Principles

Internal mental model. Not for external sharing.

## The Mapping

| Witcher | Stack | Essence |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Geralt** | CEDA | Silent work, walks between worlds, does the hard thing |
| **Jaskier** | Herald | Carries stories, makes patterns known, the bard |
| **Yennefer** | Wave | Transforms raw power into value, fierce, beautiful |
| **Ciri** | The new world to be born | The transformation itself, the future emerging |

## Why It Works

- Geralt doesn't seek glory → CEDA is backend, invisible
- Jaskier makes Geralt legendary → Herald carries patterns into sessions
- Yennefer has her own power → Wave serves business users, not just devs
- They all orbit Ciri → The user's accumulated wisdom is the real treasure

## The Mission

Ciri isn't one chosen one.
Ciri is **every human** traversing AI worlds.
Every human compounding their wisdom.
Every human becoming more than they were.

The new world isn't coming.
It's being born through each of us.

CEDA/Herald/Wave serves **all Ciris**.
Pattern memory for every human walking between worlds.

## The Philosophy

The Witcher walks between worlds.
